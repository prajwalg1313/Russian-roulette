# Russian Roulette (Python)
A simple terminal-based Russian Roulette game built in Python. Spin the chamber, pull the trigger, and see if luck is on your side.

## How it works
- The revolver has 6 chambers.
- One random chamber contains a bullet.
- You pull the trigger once per round.
- If the bullet matches your chamber, you lose. Otherwise, you survive.
